    Why are they relevant?
    Understanding node properties is crucial when working with the Document Object Model (DOM) in web development. The DOM represents the structure of HTML documents as a tree of nodes, allowing developers to access, manipulate, and update HTML elements dynamically.
    Node properties provide essential information about each node in the DOM, enabling developers to interact with the document effectively.
    Why are they needed?
    Node properties facilitate various tasks, such as traversing the DOM, querying specific elements, updating content dynamically, and handling user interactions.
    They offer insights into the structure and content of HTML documents, empowering developers to build responsive and interactive web applications.
    How are they used in projects or real-time implementations?
    In web development projects, node properties are frequently utilized for tasks like form validation, dynamic content generation, event handling, and more.
    Real-time implementations leverage node properties to create dynamic user interfaces, update content based on user actions or server responses, and maintain the state of interactive elements.
